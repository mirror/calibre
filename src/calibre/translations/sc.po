"Functions\n"
"        defined here are usable in templates in the same way that builtin\n"

"        <p><code>evaluate(self, formatter, kwargs, mi, locals, your "

"        <li><b>formatter</b>: the instance of the formatter being used to\n"
"        evaluate the current template. You can use this to do recursive\n"

"        <li><b>kwargs</b>: a dictionary of metadata. Field values are in "
"this\n"
"        dictionary.\n"
"        <li><b>mi</b>: a Metadata instance. Used to get field information.\n"
"        This parameter can be None in some cases, such as when evaluating\n"
"        non-book templates.</li>\n"
"        <li><b>locals</b>: the local variables assigned to by the current\n"
"        template program.</li>\n"
"        <li><b>your parameters</b>: You must supply one or more formal\n"
"        parameters. The number must match the arg count box, unless arg "
"count is\n"
"        -1 (variable number or arguments), in which case the last argument "
"must\n"
"        be *args. At least one argument is required, and is usually the "
"value of\n"
"        the field being operated upon. Note that when writing in basic "

"        mode, the user does not provide this first argument. Instead it is\n"
"        supplied by the formatter.</li>\n"
"        </ul></p>\n"

"from a standard field is named for the value in that field. For example, if\n"

"category. If two books have fields that generate the same collection name,\n"
"then both books will be in that collection.\n"
"This set of tweaks lets you specify for a standard or custom field how\n"

"standard field, for example 'Foo (Tag)' instead of the 'Foo'. You can also "

"There are two related tweaks. The first determines the category name to use\n"
"for a metadata field.  The second is a template, used to determines how the\n"
"value and category are combined to create the collection name.\n"
"The syntax of the first tweak, sony_collection_renaming_rules, is:\n"
"{'field_lookup_name':'category_name_to_use', 'lookup_name':'name', ...}\n"
"The second tweak, sony_collection_name_template, is a template. It uses the\n"

"never empty. The {category} field can be empty. The default is to put the\n"
"value first, then the category enclosed in parentheses, it isn't empty:\n"
"'{value} {category:|(|)}'\n"
"Examples: The first three examples assume that the second tweak\n"
"has not been changed.\n"
"1: I want three series columns to be merged into one set of collections. "
"The\n"
"column lookup names are 'series', '#series_1' and '#series_2'. I want "
"nothing\n"
"in the parenthesis. The value to use in the tweak value would be:\n"
"sony_collection_renaming_rules={'series':'', '#series_1':'', "
"'#series_2':''}\n"
"2: I want the word '(Series)' to appear on collections made from series, "
"and\n"
"the word '(Tag)' to appear on collections made from tags. Use:\n"
"sony_collection_renaming_rules={'series':'Series', 'tags':'Tag'}\n"
"3: I want 'series' and '#myseries' to be merged, and for the collection "
"name\n"
"to have '(Series)' appended. The renaming rule is:\n"
"sony_collection_renaming_rules={'series':'Series', '#myseries':'Series'}\n"
"4: Same as example 2, but instead of having the category name in "

"and appended to the value, I want it prepended and separated by a colon, "
"such\n"
"as in Series: Darkover. I must change the template used to format the "
